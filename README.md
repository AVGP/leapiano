LEAPiano
========
## Demo of a LeapMotion controlled piano 
### in HTML/CSS/Javascript only

Connect your LeapMotion, launch your browser, point to the index.html.
Hold a few fingers over your LeapMotion and move them as if you were hitting a keyboard (or, more appropriately, playing a piano).

The sounds are generated via Data URIs only. No audio files were harmed in the process of making this demo.
See http://mrcoles.com/piano/ - this is where I got the idea (and the code for audio.js) from.
